def process_motion_sense_accelerometer_files(accelerometer_data_folder_path):
    """
    Preprocess the accelerometer files of the MotionSense dataset into the 'user-list' format
    Data files can be found at https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense/tree/master/data

    Parameters:

        accelerometer_data_folder_path (str):
            the path to the folder containing the data files (unzipped)
            e.g. motionSense/B_Accelerometer_data/
            the trial folders should be directly inside it (e.g. motionSense/B_Accelerometer_data/dws_1/)

    Return:

        user_datsets (dict of {user_id: [(sensor_values, activity_labels)]})
            the processed dataset in a dictionary, of type {user_id: [(sensor_values, activity_labels)]}
            the keys of the dictionary is the user_id (participant id)
            the values of the dictionary are lists of (sensor_values, activity_labels) pairs
                sensor_values are 2D numpy array of shape (length, channels=3)
                activity_labels are 1D numpy array of shape (length)
                each pair corresponds to a separate trial
                    (i.e. time is not contiguous between pairs, which is useful for making sliding windows, where it is easy to separate trials)
